# This folder contains custom Streamlit components (widgets) that use JS and HTML.
# Place your component subfolders or files here, e.g.:
#   components/my_widget/
#   components/another_widget/
# Each component should be organized in its own subfolder with relevant JS, HTML, and Python integration code.
